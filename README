This creates meshes using a version of meshpy - tetgen/triangle/gmsh wrapped in python using boost.
It creates cubes with 3 layers of varying thickness, and using adaptive meshing.
Each layer has a minimum of three nodes for use in ADH.
This also prints out the facets and nodes into a file as well.

At the current moment it is creating the node cards from the elevation of the nodes which will not work if the bottom of the mesh is not flat.  This would probably require creating our own version of tetgen.cxx to resolve this.
